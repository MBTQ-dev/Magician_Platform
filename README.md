## 🏗️ Architecture

### Current API Architecture

The platform uses a **unified Express.js API server** with modular routes:

- **Main Server**: `server/index.ts` - Express server with lazy-loaded routes for memory efficiency
- **Route Registration**: `server/routes.ts` - Central registration of all API routes
- **Modular Routes**: `server/routes/*.ts` - Individual route handlers for:
  - Business formation (`businessFormationRoutes.ts`)
  - Ecosystem services (`ecosystemRoutes.ts`)
  - AI/ML operations (`ai.ts`, `anthropic.ts`, `openai-test.ts`)
  - 360 Magicians (`magiciansRoutes.ts`)
  - Storage and file management (`storage.ts`)
  - And more...

### Services Layer

Business logic is organized in `server/services/`:
- **notionService.ts**: Notion API integration for knowledge management
- **northwestAgentService.ts**: Business entity formation through Northwest Registered Agent
- **deafAuthService.ts**: Authentication for deaf-first platform
- **fibonroseService.ts**: Reputation scoring system
- **magicians/**: 360 Magicians AI agents (GatekeeperMagician, ReputationTrackerMagician, etc.)

### Legacy Files Note

Legacy standalone API files have been archived to `archived_legacy_files/` (excluded from git). See `ARCHIVED_FILES.md` for details on migrated functionality.

## 🔄 Database Management

We use Drizzle ORM for database operations. Some useful commands:

```bash
# Push schema changes to database
npm run db:push

# Generate migration files
npm run db:generate

# Open Drizzle Studio (database UI)
npm run db:studio
```

## 📦 Deployment

The application is configured for deployment on Vercel:

```bash
node scripts/vercel-deploy.js
```
